							<h2>Welcome to my Page!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hi there! My name's Eddie and I'm currently a Junior at Case Western Reserve University (class of 2022) studying computer science
                            and statistics, with a minor in business management. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
							I first became fascinated with coding after my best friend built a spambot that flooded
							my inbox with emails. He wouldn't show me how he did it, so I decided to learn how to make one myself.
							 Now, after almost three years of taking programming
							classes, pursuing my own side projects, and researching tools and frameworks, I think I've finally developed enough
							skills to get him back! <br/> <br/>
							All in all, I've grown to love the process of solving difficult problems, fixing challenging bugs, and exploring new concepts.
							I love being able to instantly see if my program works or not, and am always excited to see a project idea slowly come to fruition. Within the domain of software engineering, I'm primarily interested
							in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
						In my free time, you can catch me on the tennis courts, playing chess with friends, lifting at the gym, 
						or strumming my guitar.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Thanks again for stopping by! Be sure to check out some of my projects below!

								<h3>CWRU Club Tennis Website</h3>
								<p><em>When I was first asked to build a website for the club tennis team, I wasn't sure where to begin. After all, the only 
									other "website" I'd ever made just included a bunch of hyperlinks to my social media profiles. I hadn't even deployed the site!
									I had learned a bit of WXML and WXSS from a previous internship, but wasn't too certain how much this experience would help.
									<br/>
									<br/>
									I began by looking up online YouTube tutorials on "How to make a website from scratch." 
									In these videos, I got to learn more about different HTML tags and CSS, as well as a little bit more of Javascript. From there, I started looking into Bootstrap and React and 
									was able to slowly begin building up the website on my own IDE. 
									And after a few days of reading online documentation and playing around with my code, I ended up with a pretty decent website - one which will 
									serve as the official website for the Case Western Reserve University club tennis team starting Fall 2020!

								<h3>Automating 5 Bots in 5 Days</h3>
								<p><em></em>
									5-Bots-in-5 was a project that I began one week before my summer 2020 internship started. This summer,
									there were just so many unfortunate events that occurred. As a response, I decided to spend 6-8 hours
									a day programming different kinds of bots that would spread positivity and good vibes. Ultimately, I built <br/> <br/>
									
								1) A <a href="https://github.com/EddieXu123/Tinder-Bot" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(243, 78, 13);">Tinder</a> bot that "swiped right" on everyone and would send wholesome messages to all matches. <br/>
									2) A <a href="https://github.com/EddieXu123/LinkedIn-Bot" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(23, 84, 216);">LinkedIn</a> bot that posted positive status updates and sent recruiters kind, personalized messages. <br/>
									3) An <a href="https://github.com/EddieXu123/Instagram-Bot" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(140, 0, 255);">Instagram</a> bot that would go to different profiles, "like" all of the user's posts, and comment kind, unique things under each post. <br/>
									4) A <a href="https://github.com/EddieXu123/YouTube-Bot" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">YouTube</a> bot that would log into your account and "like" every video on someone's channel. <br/>
									5) An <a href="https://github.com/EddieXu123/Amazon-Bot" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Amazon</a> bot that would buy your groceries, selecting each item's best-sellers and choosing the cheapest shipping option that didn't require Amazon Prime.<br/> <br/>
									
									Overall, the experience was definitely super cool. I got to learn more about how to use PyTesseract to bypass the initial 6-digit SMS verification code that is sent to your phone,
									how to use Selenium and Chromedriver, and how the bot can "interact" with webpages through HTML attributes. An added bonus was seeing all of the amazing responses!
